In my previous role, I encountered a challenging situation where I was assigned with a P1 (Priority 1) task and I had to work for 16 hours in the office. The issue was some of the wrong data coming from downstream and I had to collaborate with a team member who had a different working style and communication approach. The team member tended to be resistant to feedback and was often dismissive of others' ideas, creating tension within the team.
