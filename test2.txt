My project is basically a centralized messaging system If any project wants to send any email or any kind of text message they use this system. what they do is they produce a message into the Kafka topic with the template ID and given data. We do have a messaging service in the place which consumes data from this Kafka topic and then processes that request by reading the configuration from the Mongo database send it to our clients, also here we can do the centralized blocking for any recipient or sender.

the same event is being consumed by another service that is a reporting service that pushes data into the elastic search database from there we can show on the dashboard which user how many emails, when the communication had been made and what are the total emails that have been done today and what are the total failures parson everything is kept track of.
